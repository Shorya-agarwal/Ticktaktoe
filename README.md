# TICKTAKTOE GAME IN PYTHON

I coded this tick tak toe game in python. It basically contains two files one is player.py and other is game.py . 
It's 100% based on object oriented programmming both files containaing diffrent classes
I followed a instructor on youtube while making this games and make significnat changes and logic according to my need



I also added a little basic of artificial intelligence by applying minimax algorithm and made computer play the game intellegently by itself
I have added both options if you wanna play either with just computer or with artificial intelligence.
While Playing with artificial Intelligence the game will draw or either human player will loose .



Take a bet  :D ðŸ˜‰
